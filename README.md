If you’ve ever built a web application in React, you probably encountered a few problems along the way, particularly with state management. That’s why the Redux Toolkit can be so helpful—plus, it’s so friendly and easy to use. Join software engineer and React expert Ebenezer Don to learn the basics of using Redux Toolkit for state management in React apps. Get a step-by-step introduction to creating a Redux store; working with reducers, actions, and slices; and setting up your own web app project using built-in tools and commands. Find out how to export each of your components and retrieve data whenever you need it, fetching data with API requests or using hooks directly from the store. By the end of this course, you’ll be ready to start accessing and managing fetched data from multiple sources.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
